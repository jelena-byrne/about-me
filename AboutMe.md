Hello and welcome to my personal GitHub!

My name is Jelena Byrne and this a space for all my personal projects I practice while pursuing a self-learning path to a software developer career. The projects are mostly Python based, but hopefully that will extend into CSS, HTML, JavaScript and the whole shabang.

My current interests are in AI/ML (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning), but to fully be able to immerse myself into such topics, I am still trying to master the basics.
At the moment, I am in process of obtaining the Snowflake certification. Following that I hope to explore various other topics and decide on the directiong of my next certification.

If you'd like to know more about my experience and contact me, please feel free to connect on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/jelenabyrne/
